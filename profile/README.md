# SUSTAINED improvement in DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM.

Dependence on materal comfort results in dependency, addiction, enslavement and ultimately inconsolable abject despair.

If someone could improve by just 3% over two weeks, they more than double their output [however they measure it in $, health or spiritual well-being] in less one year. This 2X/yr improvement discipline compounded over a lifetime would easily make any human the richest, most successful person in the world if they counted their wealth monetarially, but few can continuously compound the improvement of their discipline  ... *far fewer can choose wisely where they should store their wealth.*

SUSTAINING improvement in discipline is easy to explain ... but it's difficult to comprehend until after you have done it. It is almost impossible to sustain over long periods of time.

* ***EACH second of each 86400 second day must improve the DISCIPLINE of each following second.***

* ***Instill CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING discipline by focusing on this NOWNESS of personal improvement.*** 

In the end, it is the **DISCIPLINE** of improvement which **equals FREEDOM** ... there is no other path to freedom. You can never buy freedom or give it to others. There are addictive materialist illusions of freedom, there is no substitute for not needing anything. 

Sustain this mantra of "DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM" based upon your own exercise and execution of continuous compounded improvement until you find a better mantra.

# Zero Overhead Philanthropy

Funding is not the answer to most problems. If something really matters, then ***GIVE YOUR TIME***, give your disciplined effort and leadership, coach discipline in others, sustain discipline by exercise to drive the understanding of why DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM.

If something really matters, then thoroughly **give YOUR DISCIPLINED BEING** to the effort directly, do it personally in a focused manner that will sustain the improvement in the disipline effort which will lead to the ELIMINATION of the problem.

*Stop feeling good about writing checks or practicing idiot compassion.* If you actually care, then ***EMBODY genuine compassion.*** BE engaged as a REAL human ... not just a problem solver gadget, but a human. Give yourself to eliminating problems rather than fundraising to fund perpetual fundraising to fund more perpetual fundraising to possibly make somebody dependent upon a distribution from the organinzation. ***EMBODY the continously improving discipline of genuine compassion.***
