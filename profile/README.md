***The FACT that drives checkbook charity and the use of guilt to contribute to charities is that most [if not almost ALL] philanthropies are nothing but fundraising organizations that raise funds in order to raise funds in order to sustain the perpetuation of the fundraising organization.***

Therefore, this Github *organization* known as SustainFund is a curated collection of repositories of curated lists and resources exist as proof that of #NoOverhead venture philanthropies can sponsor and maintain funding to sustain charitable efforts.  

In other words, if you see someone who needs a sandwich, make them a sandwich -- don't donate to an organization that funds operations which might buy people sandwiches -- almost of all the money you give ends up funding virtue signallers and almost nothing actually gets the hungry person the sandwich.

If it were not obvious ... there's absolutely NO MONEY in SustainFund. This open source curated collections of repositories prove that money is generally UNNECESSARY ... if you want to help someone, ***then just roll up your sleeves and HELP someone human-to-human*** -- don't write a check or text #BullshitConsciousClearing to BullshitConsciousClearning.com ... 

If something really matters, then ***GIVE YOUR TIME***, *give YOURSELF to sustaining the cause.
