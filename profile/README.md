# Zero Overhead Philanthropy

*BE a human. BE a problem solver. EMBODY genuine compassion ... give yourself to eliminating problems rather than fundraising to fund perpetual fundraising to fund more perpetual fundraising to possibly make somebody dependent upon a distribution from the organinzation. Stop feeling good about writing checks or practicing idiot compassion. EMBODY genuine compassion*

If something really matters, then ***GIVE YOUR TIME***, give your inspired intellect, give your mind, give your ideas ... *give a legitimate shit DAILY* ... thoroughly **give YOURSELF** to directly, personally sustaining the disipline that will lead to the ELIMINATION of the problem.

The most powerful thing that we can give others is the example of how to build discipline. DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM. Most of people cannot use the time that they are given, as you attempt to provide an example, you will improve your own discipline. It comes down the following process ... it's simple to comprehend, but very difficult to actually do.

* ***EACH second of each 86400 second day must improve the DISCIPLINE of each following second.***

* ***Instill CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING discipline by focusing on the NOWNESS of your improvement.*** If you can improve by just 3% over two weeks, you can more than double your output in less one year. This 2X/yr improvement discipline compounded over a lifetime would make any human the richest person in the world; few can continuously compound their improvement ... *fewer can choose where they should store their wealth.*

In the end, DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM ... there is no other path to freedom ... sustain this mantra of continuous compounded improvement until you find a better one.
