# SUSTAINED improvement in DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM.

Dependence on materal comfort results in dependency, addiction, enslavement and ultimately inconsolable abject despair.

SUSTAINING improvement in discipline is very simple to explain ... it's difficult to comprehend until after you have done it, but very difficult to actually do over long periods of time.

* ***EACH second of each 86400 second day must improve the DISCIPLINE of each following second.***

* ***Instill CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING discipline by focusing on the NOWNESS of your improvement.*** If you can improve by just 3% over two weeks, you can more than double your output in less one year. This 2X/yr improvement discipline compounded over a lifetime would easily make any human the richest person in the world if they counted their wealth monetarially, but few can continuously compound the improvement of their discipline  ... *far fewer can choose wisely where they should store their wealth.*

In the end, DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM ... there is no other path to freedom ... sustain this mantra of continuous compounded improvement until you find a better one.

# Zero Overhead Philanthropy

If something really matters, then ***GIVE YOUR TIME***, give your disciplined example, build discipline in others, DISCIPLINE equals FREEDOM.

If something really matters, then thoroughly **give YOUR DISCIPLINED MIND** to the effort directly, personally sustaining the improvement disipline that will lead to the ELIMINATION of the problem.

*Stop feeling good about writing checks or practicing idiot compassion.* ***EMBODY genuine compassion.*** BE a REAL human. BE a problem solver. Give yourself to eliminating problems rather than fundraising to fund perpetual fundraising to fund more perpetual fundraising to possibly make somebody dependent upon a distribution from the organinzation. ***EMBODY the continously improving discipline of genuine compassion.***
